# Controlling-bots-using-webcam

In this project, a four wheeled bot was controlled using an overhead camera. The bot didn't have any sensor mounted on it.

### Hardware used
- Nodemcu esp8266 board - as brain of robot
- L298n motor driver
- 4- 250 rpm plastic gear motors
- Two 3.7v Li-ion battery
- Phone camera 

### Software used
- IP Webcam app - to live stream the feed directly using android mobile

## Summary
## Further scope 
- This project can be very easily scaled to multiple robots. The robot motion can be improved by applying PID control algorithm. The localization of the bot can be improved further using Aruco markers
