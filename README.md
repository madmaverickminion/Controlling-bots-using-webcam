# Controlling-bots-using-webcam

In this project, a four wheeled bot was controlled using an overhead camera. The bot didn't have any sensor mounted on it.

### Hardware used
- Nodemcu esp8266 board - as brain of robot
- L298n motor driver
- 4- 250 rpm plastic gear motors
- Two 3.7v Li-ion battery
- Phone camera 

### Software used
- IP Webcam app - to live stream the feed directly using android mobile


## Further scope 
- This project can be very easily scaled to multiple robots. 
- The motion of the robot can be improved by applying PID control algorithm. 
- The robot tracking in real time can be improved using Aruco markers.
